The eUsage app allows you to manage usage data reports for electronic resources.

The app provides automatic harvesting of COUNTER standard usage reports via SUSHI and manual uploading of standard and non-standard statistics. Usage data providers managed in eUsage can be referred to from the Agreements app.


## Definition of terms

* **Aggregator**. A service that aggregates pre-processing statistics for multiple statistics providers and offers an endpoint to download the reports. eUsage allows you to harvest statistics for a usage data provider either directly from the provider via SUSHI or from an aggregator. The only aggregator service currently supported in FOLIO is the German National Statistics Server. 
* **COUNTER** and **SUSHI.** Standard format and protocol for electronic resource usage statistics. Detailed information is available at[ Project COUNTER](https://www.projectcounter.org/).
* **Report.** The usage data for a certain set of electronic resources within a certain reporting period in a specific type.
* **Usage data provider.** The agent that provides usage statistics for a set of electronic resources. Most likely, this is a vendor or a platform provider. The usage data provider record is the basic entity in eUsage used to manage all associated reports and harvesting processes.


## **Permissions**

The permissions listed below allow you to interact with the eUsage app and determine what you can or cannot do within the app. You can assign permissions to users in the Users app. If none of these permissions are assigned to a user, they are unable to see the eUsage app or any related information.

The following are all the eUsage permissions:


* **eUsage: All permissions.** Ths permission includes all other eUsage permissions.
* **eUsage: Can view usage data providers and view/download usage reports.** This is the eUsage read permission which allows the user to view usage data provider records and view and download the associated usage reports.
* **eUsage: Can create and edit usage data providers.** This permission allows the user to create and edit UDP records. It does not include the upload of usage reports to the provider.
* **eUsage: Can delete usage data providers.** This permission allows the user to delete UDP records. It does not include the deletion of the associated usage reports.
* **eUsage: Can upload usage reports.** This permission allows the user to upload COUNTER and non-COUNTER usage reports.
* **eUsage: Can start harvesting for a single provider.** This permission allows the user to start the harvester service for one UDP.
* **eUsage: Can delete usage reports.** This permission allows the user to delete COUNTER and non-COUNTER usage reports.
* **Settings (eUsage): Can view and edit settings.** This permission allows the user to view and edit the eUsage settings. It also includes starting the harvester for all usage data providers in the tenant.


## Creating a usage data provider

When you create a usage data provider, you are asked to enter the configuration details for automated harvesting. If the provider only supports manual data download, you still need to create a provider record in order to upload reports manually to this provider. For more information on manual report upload, see Uploading reports manually.

1. In the **Usage data provider** pane, click **New**.
2. In the **Create usage data provider** window, fill in the **Usage data provider information** and **Harvesting configuration** sections. For more information on the fields and actions available in these sections, see the section descriptions below.
3. Once you have included all of the information you want about the Usage data provider, click **Save & close**. The usage data provider is saved and added to the Usage data providers pane.


### Usage data provider information

* **Provider name (required).** Enter the name of the usage data provider.
* **Description.** A description of the usage data provider. You can use this field to enter additional information in order to identify the provider or any other data corresponding to the usage data provider or reports that should be displayed in a prominent place at the record.


### Harvesting configuration

* **Harvesting status (required).** Select a Harvesting status: Active or Inactive. The status you select here defines whether reports from the usage data provider are harvested in the automated or manually triggered harvesting processes.
* **Harvest statistics via (required).** Select how to harvest statistics: Aggregator or Sushi. Note: The only aggregator currently supported by FOLIO is the German National Statistics Server.
* **Aggregator (required).** If you have selected to harvest statistics via an aggregator, select the aggregator that should be used to harvest statistics. Note: The only aggregator currently supported by FOLIO is the German National Statistics Server.
* **Vendor code.** If you have selected to harvest statistics via an aggregator, enter the code by which the aggregator identifies the vendor for which statistics are requested. The German National Statistics Server requires the vendor names as displayed in the server’s user interface.
* **Service type (required).** If you have selected to harvest statistics via a SUSHI protocol, select the SUSHI service type implementation to be used by the harvester: Counter-Sushi 4.1 or Counter-Sushi 5.0. The service type normally corresponds to the requested Report release.
* **Service URL (required).** If you have selected to harvest statistics via a SUSHI protocol, enter the URL to access the SUSHI service. The URL is usually listed on the provider’s backend information pages. \
Note: Only enter the_ base URL_ to the service, not the complete URL for an API request. For example, if the provider lists the URL[ https://usage.catsanddogs.org/sushi/reports/tr_b1](https://usage.catsanddogs.org/sushi/reports/tr_b1), only enter the part _before (and excluding) "reports"_:[ https://usage.catsanddogs.org/sushi](https://usage.catsanddogs.org/sushi). Everything else is added by the harvester.
* **Report release (required).** Select a Report release: Counter 4 or Counter 5. Note: Support for release 5 of the Counter standard is mandatory for Counter compliant vendors from January 2019. FOLIO does not support simultaneous harvesting of reports of both releases for one usage data provider. If you want to retrospectively harvest Counter 4 reports, configure the provider for Counter 4 first and harvest the requested reports. Then edit the usage data provider and configure for Counter 5 harvesting.
* **Requested report (required).** Add the report types requested to be harvested for the usage data provider. For more information, see Adding a report type.
* **Harvesting start (required)**. Enter the first month for the reports that are to be harvested.
* **Harvesting end.** Enter the last month for the reports that are to be harvested. Note: You may want to add an end month in case no more resources are licensed from a provider, a provider stops supporting usage statistics, or for any other reason that no ongoing harvesting is wanted. If no harvesting end is configured, reports are harvested continuously until the Harvesting status is changed to Inactive.
* **Customer ID (required for SUSHI).** If you have selected to harvest statistics via a SUSHI protocol, enter the customer ID assigned by the provider. This information is usually listed on the provider’s backend information pages.
* **Requestor ID.** Enter the Requestor ID assigned by the provider. If needed, this information is usually listed on the provider’s backend information pages. Not all SUSHI services require a Requestor ID.
* **API key.** Enter the API key assigned by the provider. If needed, this information is usually listed on the provider’s backend information pages. Not all SUSHI services require an API key.
* **Platform.** Enter the Platform for which reports are requested. If needed, this information is usually listed on the provider’s backend information pages. Most SUSHI services default on all platforms for which a customer has licensed resources.
* **Requestor name.** Enter the requestor name assigned by the provider. If needed, this information is usually listed on the provider’s backend information pages. Not all SUSHI services require a Requestor name.
* **Requestor mail.** Enter the requestor mail assigned by the provider. If needed, this information is usually listed on the provider’s backend information pages. Not all SUSHI services require a Requestor mail.
